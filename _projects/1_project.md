Our previous picture said that the elastic effect in dense suspensions under impact only takes place when there is a percolating force chains from the impactor to the bottom plate. This is only true for shallow cases since the floating dynamically jammed region itself might have a finite elasticity. We then define the region based on peak in the strain rate fields and calculate the deformation based on the contact deformation of the suspended particles. Then, we can calculate the elastic modulus as shown in figure below
