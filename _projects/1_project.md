What exactly happened when a person is able to run on top of a dense suspension? We perform a particles-based with free surface simulation that unveils the microscopic mechanism behind the impact on dense suspensions.
For a simple free-falling impactor setup, we observed a strong hardening of suspensions that can make the impactor rebounds.
We also find a power-law relations between impact velocity and maximum force on the impactor.
From our simulations, we found that rebounds only take place when there is a percolating force chains from the impactor to the bottom plate.
A phemenology is then proposed to explain the above pictures.
